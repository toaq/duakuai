there are two parts to a query: the head and the body.
the head is everything between the :q and the first flag.
the body is all the flags with their arguments

to perform a search, you pass some terms to the query.
:q -w mai
:q -d love
:q -g love
:q -u solpahi
these are all valid searches.
each flag represents a field in the database. Passing an 
argument to it means that duakuai will return values for that
field that match the argument.

some fields are:
  w	word
  d	definition
  u	user
  g	gloss
  f	frame

the head itself can be modified, to change what the query
returns, or how many results.

:ql -w mai
  query list: return how many 
:q10 -w mai
:qA -w mai

:q -w mai -u solpahi
:qA -w mai -u solpahi
:qA -d| love -d affection
:qA -dr (love|affec)

:q d+offi -w mai
  search in the official dictionary
:q d+offi+comm -w mai
   search in both official and community
   this is the default behaviour, equivalent to
   :q -w mai
:q d+comm -w mai
   search the community dictionary
:q f+definition+fields+user -w mai
   of the answers, show the definition, fields, and user who made the word

these are the flags you can refer to when looking for a field
"w"     : "word",
"f"     : "frame",      # todo
"k"     : "keywords",    # todo
"i"     : "id",
"d"     : "definition",
"u"     : "user",
"s"     : "scope",      # language the entry is written in
"v"     : "votes",
"r"     : "score",
"n"     : "notes",
"y"     : "type",
"g"     : "gloss",
"i"     : "distribution",
"a"     : "namesake",
"e"     : "examples",
"l"     : "fields"

these are the modifications to the flags yo can do
"|"     : ('logic', "or")
    this searches with or instead of and. that is
    :q -w| mai -w dua
    search all entries that have either mai or dua

these define how the value of the field matches with the query
"r"     : ("match_fun", "regexp"),
    match the field to a regular expression
    :qA -wr ^.+mai$
    will match all words that end with 'mai'
    regexpes are kinda hard, so you don't need to use this mode
"s"     : ("match_fun", "syllable"),
    search for words that contain the exact syllable
    this is usefull because many words in toaq are compounds of meaningful syllables.
    :qA -ws du
    returns all the words with 'du' as opposed to 'dua' or 'dui' 
"e"     : ("match_fun", "exact")
    return exact matches
    :qA -we du
    this only returns results for the word 'du', nothing about 'dutao' or 'duruaq'
