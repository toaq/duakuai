there are two parts to a query: the head and the body.
the head is everything between the :q and the first flag.
the body is all the flags with their arguments

to perform a search, you pass some terms to the query.
:q -w mai
:q -d love
:q -g love
:q -u solpahi
these are all valid searches.
each flag represents a field in the database. Passing an 
argument to it means that duakuai will return values for that
field that match the argument.

some fields are:
  w	word
  d	definition
  u	user
  g	gloss
  f	frame

the head itself can be modified, to change what the query
returns, or how many results.

:ql -w mai
  query list: return how many 
:q10 -w mai
:qA -w mai

:q -w mai -u solpahi
:qA -w mai -u solpahi
:qA -d| love -d affection
:qA -dr (love|affec)

:q offi -w mai
:q comm -w mai

all flags
all mods
